안녕!! The name’s Brenden and I’m a game developer who specializes in game design with a background in illustration and animation. My expertise lies in crafting immersive gaming experiences that seamlessly integrate engaging gameplay mechanics with visually stunning aesthetics. My fascination with design comes from both player-to-player interactions and player-to-environment dynamics to maintain and preserve immersion.

I’m currently attending George Mason University pursuing a bachelor's degree in Computer Game Design with a minor in Computer Science. I’m also currently an Assistant Design Director at GADIG, a video game studio founded on and supported by George Mason University. I also develop indie games in my freetime along with participating in various game jams with other developers and creatives.

My targeted fields of study are in….
- Character, Environmental, and Prop Design
- Level Design
- Narrative Design
- Systems and Mechanics (i.e. Combat and Progression)

Overall I’m a highly motivated and moldable game developer who’s accumulated about two years of industry experience at indies, who’s looking for opportunities to further their horizon. I hope you enjoy my work and I look forward to potentially working with you!
